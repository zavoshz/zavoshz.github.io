Barry - An AI personal assistant powered by Api.ai
========

An app that shows how to use the Api.ai HTML and JS SDK to build a simple AI personal assistant.

If you build your own personal assistant from this code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com. I'd love to have a look!

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I also write all about emerging tech over at [Dev Diner](http://www.devdiner.com) (http://www.devdiner.com)!
